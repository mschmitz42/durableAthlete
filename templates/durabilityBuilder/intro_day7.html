            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>


            <p>Day 7 already—halfway through the 14-Day Durability Kickstart. By now, you’ve probably uncovered
                challenges you didn’t even know you had. Maybe a tight squat, low run cadence, or realizing just how
                much mobility and technique matter.</p>

            <p>Here’s the truth: most triathletes skip this stuff, and it’s costing them. You can keep piling on miles
                or grinding through hard sessions, but if you’re training with poor form and limited mobility, you’re
                only reinforcing bad habits—or worse, setting yourself up for injury.</p>

            <p>That’s why this program isn’t about just handing you a plan. It’s about showing you what to focus on, why
                it matters, and how to actually improve. Because if you keep doing what you’ve been doing, you’re going
                to keep getting what you’ve got.</p>

            <p>Think about it: testing on Day 1 showed you where you were starting from. Training this week addressed
                those weaknesses. Today, we retest so you can see what’s changed—and what still needs work. That’s how
                lasting progress is built: test, train, retest, adjust, repeat.</p>

            <p>This is what separates durable athletes from those stuck in the injury-recovery loop. Durability isn’t
                about working harder—it’s about training smarter, stacking wins, and showing up stronger, race after
                race.</p>


            <div class="section-subtitle">Today’s Mobility and Technique Challenge:</div>

            <p>Time to check your homework. The squat retest shows how much range of motion you’ve gained, and the “Next
                Level” run cadence retest brings it all together to see if your stride has leveled up.</p>
