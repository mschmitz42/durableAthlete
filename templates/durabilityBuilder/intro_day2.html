            <div class="section-title">The 2 beliefs that have wasted years of progress in triathlon…</div>


            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>

            <p>Yesterday’s squat test and cadence check set the stage for building durability and breaking the injury
                cycle. You took the first step toward moving better and training smarter.</p>

            <p>When I first started, I didn’t have that clarity. Ever feel like no matter how many miles you slog
                through or how many yards you swim, you just don’t see the progress you were hoping for?</p>

            <p>That was me 20+ years ago—stuck, frustrated, and a little embarrassed by my triathlon performance.</p>

            <p>I thought the answer was simple: push through the pain. Ignore the aches, tough it out, and eventually
                I’d get faster. I didn’t.</p>

            <p>Every day, I woke up feeling like “the morning after” even though I hadn’t partied the night before. The
                pain ramped up, my pace slowed, and my confidence tanked—all because of two beliefs that wasted years of
                progress:</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Belief #1:</span> “I just need to push through the pain to stay fit.” I’d grind
                through knee, foot, shoulder, back and neck pain, only to be sidelined for weeks. Pushing harder without
                fixing the cause just digs a deeper hole.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Belief #2:</span> “I need to stop everything so I can heal.” I tried this too.
                You stop, lose fitness, then restart—only for the same problem to flare up again.</p>


            <p>Here’s what I wish I knew earlier: the difference between good pain and bad pain.</p>

            <p>Good pain is the muscle soreness after a tough workout—a sign your body is adapting and growing stronger.
                It generally subsides within a few days.<br/>Bad pain, on the other hand, is sharp, searing, or
                persistent. Like feeling something stabbing you from the inside or experiencing electrical charges in a
                specific body part.</p>

            <p>Once I understood the difference, I stopped bouncing between overtraining and the couch. I didn’t need to
                quit or grind myself down.<br/>I needed a smarter system.</p>

            <p>That’s when I discovered structured technique and mobility training. Not a random internet tip—a proven
                blueprint for building durability. Once I focused on moving better, not just moving more, everything
                changed: my pace improved, my body stopped fighting me, and I finally felt confident lining up for races
                again.</p>

            <p>If you’re stuck in the same loop I was, stay tuned. This program will help.</p>


            <div class="section-subtitle">Today’s Mobility and Technique Challenges are simple with a high-return:</div>

            <p>The couch stretch is brutal but brilliant. It’s like taking the e-brake off your hips—suddenly your
                stride opens up and everything just works better. Pair it with the bike cadence assessment and you’ll
                pedal smoother, save energy, and feel stronger every mile.</p>
