            <div class="section-subtitle">Ready to Train Smarter, Not Harder? Let’s Start Day 1 of the Durability
                Builder!
            </div>

            <p>Hi, Tim Sorensen here and welcome to Day 1 of the 14-Day Durability Kickstart.</p>

            <p>If you’ve joined this challenge, you’re probably tired of nagging aches and confusing advice. You might
                even feel frustrated that all your training hasn’t led to better results.</p>

            <p>You’re not alone. I know that feeling all too well. When I started triathlon at 31 years old, I thought
                the answer was to just swim hard, bike hard, and run hard—a lot! But all that effort only led to
                strains, injuries, and falling short of the gains I’d hoped for.</p>

            <p>I'd look at the pros and wonder, "If I'm putting in the work, why don't I see those results?" It honestly
                pissed me off. </p>

            <p> So, I dug deeper. Years of study, trial, error, and more trial taught me the real key wasn't
                just doing more; it was focusing on mobility, technique, strength, and injury prevention. <span
                        class="bold-text">And getting the
                     balance right.</span> That's when things finally clicked.</p>

            <p>You’ve probably been bombarded with advice: “Swim more, bike more, lift weights, go slower, go faster…”
                It’s like trying to drink from a fire hose. I get it—it’s overwhelming. </p>

            <p>So, where do you start? When do you start?</p>

            <p>First, start where you are, use what you have, and do what you can. And when? Right now!</p>

            <p>Here’s the truth: waiting for that elusive “perfect moment” to train without pain? It’s a myth. The best
                time
                to start is now.</p>

            <p>Once I shifted my focus to addressing weak points rather than piling on more training, I saw a real
                change in
                performance. It wasn’t about training harder; it was about training smarter.</p>

            <p>Now, a quick word about pain: not all pain is bad. Good pain—the satisfying burn after a solid
                workout—means
                your body’s adapting and getting stronger. Bad pain, though, is the sharp, persistent kind that signals
                something’s wrong. Learning to spot the difference is crucial.</p>

            <p>For over 25 years, I’ve refined this approach, not just for myself but for countless triathletes. They’ve
                transformed from injury-prone to durable, confident competitors. </p>

            <p>Don't get sidelined by overuse
                injuries or self-doubt. Let’s tackle what’s holding you back so you can train and race with
                confidence. </p>

            <p>For the next 14 days, I’ll be sending you one mobility or technique exercise each day—specifically for
                triathletes. Check the link at the bottom of each email to access your daily exercise, available as a
                video
                or PDF. Complete the exercises and share your feedback or a video of yourself in the community group for
                tips and support.</p>

            <p>Today’s exercises are game-changers. The squat test isn’t just about flexibility—it shows you exactly
                where your body is holding you back. The run cadence test? That’s the secret to running smoother,
                faster, and with fewer injuries.</p>

            <p>As we begin this journey together, I want to leave you with one thought that will guide us through these
                next 14 days:<br/>Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.</p>

            <p>It’s not about perfection. It’s about taking small, consistent steps that add up to big results.</p>

            <p>Check out today’s exercises and let’s kick things off strong.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow, we’ll tackle the <span class="bold-text">two beliefs that keep most triathletes stuck</span>—and
                how breaking them will save you years of wasted training.</p>

            <p>See you tomorrow!</p>
