            <div class="section-title">Shit Happens. Now What?</div>

            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>

            <p>Today, I want to talk about one of the hardest realities of being an athlete: navigating the unexpected. Because let’s be honest—shit happens. It’s not if it happens, it’s when. Injuries, crazy schedules, life curveballs—it can all feel like it’s falling apart.</p>

            <p>We’ve all heard the saying, “It’s not what happens to you; it’s how you respond.” But how do you respond?</p>

            <p>I’ve seen it firsthand. One of my athletes dreamed of completing an Ironman. His knee was trashed, but we worked around it and he crossed that finish line. Then came the knee replacement, another Ironman, and later, a pacemaker. Most people would’ve quit—but he didn’t. Today, at 67, he’s training for another half Ironman.</p>

            <p>What’s his secret? He has a powerful “why.” His fitness isn’t just about racing—it’s tied to his life, his identity, and what keeps him moving forward.</p>

            <p>Here’s what I want you to take away: setbacks don’t define you. Your response does. Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.</p>

            <p>Even if today is a mess, knock out the 3DME. And if you miss it? No biggy. Pick it up tomorrow. Progress isn’t linear—it’s consistent effort stacked over time.</p>

            <div class="section-subtitle">Today’s Mobility and Technique Challenge:</div>

            <p>The pigeon pose unlocks your hips so you can generate more power without pain. The Superman drill in the pool builds balance and control, making your stroke more effortless.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="list-title">Daily Mobility</span>: Pigeon</li>
                <li><div style="padding:40% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1102352733?h=e8d9c38801&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Pigeon Pose.mov"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></li>
                <li><span class="list-title">Technique Drill</span>: Swim-Superman Drill</li>
                <li><div style="padding:40% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1102360157?h=94ab57d18f&amp;badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Superman_Drill.mp4"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script></li>
            </ul>

            <p>Get it done, then throw your pigeon pose attempt or swim drill clip into the <a
                    href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/859964805679977" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>. I’ll check in.</p>

            <p>Just remember, shit happens. But with a strong enough "why," you’ll keep moving forward. Every stretch, drill, and workout is a step toward becoming a stronger, more durable triathlete.</p>

            <p>See you tomorrow,</p>
