            <div class="section-title">My biggest regret (don’t make the same mistake)</div>

            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>

            <p>Today I want to talk about a mistake I made that cost me years of progress, and I hope I can help you
                avoid it.</p>

            <p>For years, I battled chronic injuries and pain. I jumped from one so-called “hack” to the next, thinking
                I was doing all the right things. But nothing worked. I was stuck in the same loop: train hard, get
                hurt, recover, repeat.</p>

            <p>You know the routine: try this advice, then that one. But nothing ever seemed to cover all the bases. If
                I was going to get out of pain and back to peak performance, I needed a deeper understanding of the
                human body and what truly works for athletes like us.</p>

            <p>So, I went all in. I went back to school, studied human physiology, earned certifications, and devoted
                years to trial, error, and study. And even then, I still hadn’t found a program that checked all the
                boxes.</p>

            <p>That’s why I created one myself.</p>

            <p>The Durability Builder isn’t just a random collection of workouts—it’s the result of years of hard
                lessons, study, and figuring out exactly what gets lasting results for triathletes. It’s designed to
                help you move better, stay injury-free, and finally build the foundation you need to perform at your
                best.</p>

            <p>Imagine skipping years of trial-and-error and jumping straight into a proven system—one that integrates
                mobility, technique, strength, and endurance into a plan built for athletes like you. That’s what the
                6-Week Durability Builder does.</p>

            <div class="section-subtitle">Today’s Mobility and Technique Challenge:</div>

            <p>This hamstring stretch isn’t about touching your toes—it’s about unlocking power you’ve been leaving on
                the table. Combine it with today’s bike drill, and rolling to hilly courses won’t sap your energy
                anymore.</p>
