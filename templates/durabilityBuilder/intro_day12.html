            <div class="section-subtitle">Proof that the Durability Builder delivers real results.</div>

            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>

            <p>By now, you’ve probably asked yourself, “<span class="quoted-text">Is this program right for me?</span>”
            </p>

            <p>You’ve made it to Day 12—so if you're still unsure, I get it. You’ve likely tried programs that didn’t
                deliver. Maybe they left you injured, frustrated, or questioning whether anything truly fits your
                life.</p>

            <p>Let’s fix that.</p>

            <p>That’s exactly why I’ve created flexible, realistic options. And right now, you can jump into the 6-Week
                Durability Builder for just $118 (50% off the usual $237). It’s a special beta offer so I can gather
                your feedback and fine-tune the experience.</p>

            <p><span class="list-title">Choose what fits your life:</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Sprint Distance: ~6 hours/week</li>
                <li>Olympic Distance: ~8.5 hours/week</li>
                <li>Half Ironman (70.3): ~11 hours/week</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="list-title">Each plan includes:</span></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Structured swim, bike, and run sessions (based on HR or RPE—you choose)</li>
                <li>The 3DME system: Three Daily Mobility Exercises, every day</li>
                <li>Technique demos to reinforce strengths and improve weak links</li>
                <li>Personal feedback from me, plus email and optional coaching calls</li>
            </ul>


            <p>This isn’t a cookie-cutter plan. We start with assessments and build the program around you.</p>

            <p>Want a fully customized approach?</p>

            <p>The Premium Monthly Coaching option is just $189/month. If you sign up before Day 14 ends, I’ll waive the
                $100 setup fee. You’ll get:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A constantly evolving plan that adapts with you</li>
                <li>Strategy, gear, race advice, and support whenever you need it</li>
                <li>My full attention—every step of the way</li>
            </ul>

            <p><span class="list-title">Why work with me?</span></p>

            <p>I’ve got 25+ years of racing experience and 15 years of full-time coaching. I’ve helped athletes go from
                stuck and sore to confident and competitive—even at Kona. This isn’t just training. It’s a way to move
                through life.</p>

            <p>Here’s what a few athletes have said:</p>

            <p><span class="list-title">Brandon Pratt</span> – "<span class="quoted-text">Tim turned me from a finisher into a competitor. Four 70.3s in one year and Bronze All-World Athlete status. I’m aiming for Kona—and I know I can get there.</span>"
            </p>

            <p><span class="list-title">Kenny Bailey</span> – "<span class="quoted-text">My lifelong goal was to finish an Ironman. Tim made that possible—even from 3,000 miles away.</span>"
            </p>

            <p><span class="list-title">Natalie Marron</span> – "<span class="quoted-text">I started running at 50. With Tim’s help, I ran my first 5K, then two half-marathons—shaving 15 minutes off my second one.</span>"
            </p>

            <p><span class="list-title">Ready to take that next step?</span></p>

                <li>Go all-in with 1-on-1 monthly coaching for $189, and skip the $100 setup fee if you join by Day 14
