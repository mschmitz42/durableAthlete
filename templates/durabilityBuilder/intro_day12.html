        <div class="section-title">Is This Program Right for You? Let’s Clear That Up!</div>

        <div class="section-subtitle">Proof that the Durability Builder delivers real results</div>

      <p><span class="list-title">Hey Athletes,</span></p>
      <p>By now, you’ve probably asked yourself, “<span class="quoted-text">Is this program right for me?</span>” You're here at Day 12, and if you're
          still feeling unsure, I completely understand.</p>

      <p><span class="list-title">Here’s the thing:</span></p>

      <p>You’ve probably tried other programs that didn’t quite deliver. Maybe they left you frustrated or wondering if
          there’s something else out there that can actually work for you. You’re busy, and life often gets in the way
          of even the best training plans. It’s hard to believe something could truly fit into your life and deliver the
          results you’ve been after.</p>

      <p><span class="list-title">Let’s fix that:</span></p>

      <p>That’s exactly why I’ve created options for you to choose from.</p>

      <p>I’m offering a <span class="list-title">Special Beta Offer</span> to join the <span class="list-title">6-Week Durability Builder</span> today for just <span class="list-title">$118</span>—that’s <span class="list-title">50% off</span> the
          regular price of $237! This is an exclusive offer, and I need your feedback to make the program even better.
          But act fast—this beta offer won’t be around forever!</p>

      <p><span class="list-title">Here are your 3 options for the program:</span></p>

      <ul>
          <li><span class="list-title">Sprint Distance</span>: ~6 hours/week</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">Olympic Distance</span>: ~8.5 hours/week</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">Half Ironman Distance</span>: ~11 hours/week</li>
      </ul>


      <p><span class="list-title">All 3 versions include:</span></p>

      <ul>
          <li><span class="list-title">Swim, Bike, and Run interval workouts</span> based on heart rate zones that you set using the results of the assessments you perform in Week 1. (If you want!)</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">3DME</span> – 3 Daily Mobility Exercises</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">Demonstration Videos</span> to help you improve both your weaknesses and strengths</li>
          <li><span class="list-title">Feedback from me</span>, along with unlimited email communication and scheduled phone calls if you need them</li>
      </ul>


      <p>This program is built with flexibility to be tailored to you. We begin with an assessment of where you are,
          then customize everything around that. It’s designed to meet you where you are and help you move forward with
          confidence.</p>

      <p><span class="list-title">Want something even more personalized?</span></p>

      <p>If you’re ready to go all in, I also offer the <span class="list-title">Fully Customized Premium Monthly Program</span>.</p>

      <p>You’ll get:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A <span class="list-title">fully personalized training plan</span></li>
            <li>Adjustments based on your <span class="list-title">progress and feedback</span></li>
            <li>Expert advice on <span class="list-title">race day</span> strategy, <span class="list-title">gear selection</span>, and everything else you need</li>
        </ul>

      <p><span class="list-title">And why hire me as your coach?</span></p>

      <p>I bring over <span class="list-title">25 years of competing in triathlons</span> and <span class="list-title">14 years of coaching experience</span>. I’ve been where you are,
          and I understand what it takes to balance life, training, and health. With my guidance, you’ll stay on track,
          remain injury-free, and continue moving toward your goals.</p>

      <p><span class="list-title">Here’s what some of my athletes have to say about working with me:</span></p>
      <p><span class="list-title">Kenny Bailey</span> – "<span class="quoted-text">My lifelong goal was to finish an Ironman, and Tim made that possible. He continually monitored
          my training program, even while I was 3,000 miles away. Thanks to Tim, I’m proud to say, 'I’m an
          Ironman!'</span>"</p>
      <p><span class="list-title">Natalie Marron</span> – "<span class="quoted-text">I notice my body wasn’t quite responding to exercise the way it had in previous years so I
          decide to try something new. I started running for the first time ever while working with Tim. I ran my first
          5K, then a 10K, 10-miler, and two half-marathons—improving my time by 15 minutes on the second one!</span>"</p>
