            <div class="section-title">The wake-up call</div>

            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>

            <p>Yesterday, we broke down the two beliefs that keep triathletes stuck: pushing through pain or stopping
                completely.</p>

            <p>Today, we’re taking it a step further. In today’s video, I break down the 4 core skills—mobility,
                technique, strength, and endurance—and how they work together to keep you training strong.</p>

            <p>For me, this lesson came the hard way. My wake-up call? An IT band strain that benched me—again. I’d been
                piling on miles, skipping the “boring” stuff like mobility and technique, and my body finally said
                enough.
                During that downtime, I dug in—books, videos, research—anything I could find to figure out why I kept
                breaking down. Here’s what I learned:</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Swim:</span> My form was a mess. Fighting the water every lap—legs sinking,
                shoulder screaming like it had an ice pick in it. Once I worked on shoulder mobility and basic swim
                drills, I stopped fighting the water and started gliding like I belonged there.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Bike:</span> My hips were locked from riding and sitting all day. My pedal stroke
                was choppy, always in the wrong gear, burning out my quads. Mobility work and pedal stroke drills
                smoothed it out. Suddenly, riding farther wasn’t an issue and I was climbing like a homesick angel.</p>

            <p><span class="bold-text">Run:</span> Plantar fasciitis and I were well-acquainted. Relearning run
                mechanics and mobilizing my calves and feet was a game changer. Running stopped feeling like something I
                had to survive—and I actually started to enjoy it.</p>

            <p>That’s when it clicked: the basics aren’t just for beginners, and they’re definitely not a waste of
                time—they’re essential. When you fully engage and work to master them, they’re not boring at all.
                They’re actually pretty fun. Master the basics, and you unlock your true potential.</p>

            <p>Here’s the short version:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><span class="list-title">Mobility:</span> Free up stiff joints. Tight hips, shoulders, and ankles?
                    They’re slowing you down.
                </li>
                <li><span class="list-title">Technique:</span>Move efficiently. Think smoother run form, better pedal
                    strokes, and easier swimming.
                </li>
                <li><span class="list-title">Strength:</span>Build stability that protects you.</li>
                <li><span class="list-title">Endurance:</span>Pile this on once the first three are dialed in.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These aren’t optional. They’re the foundation of staying injury-free and finally training the way you’ve
                always wanted.</p>

            <div class="section-subtitle">Today’s Mobility and Technique Challenge:</div>

            <p>Today’s drills might look simple, but don’t underestimate them. Hips-to-heels mobility frees up your
                ankles, knees and hips so running feels easier. The swim cadence test shows you how to use the water as
                leverage instead of windmilling your arms like an inflatable car-lot dancer.</p>

            <p>Let’s see what you’ve got: post a clip or your takeaways from today’s mobility and swim drill in the
                Durability Triathlete <a
                        href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/859964805679977" target="_blank">Facebook group</a>.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow, we’ll tackle the next big objection: “I don’t have time.” I’ll show you exactly how to fit this
                in—even with a packed schedule—so you can keep training without breaking down.</p>

            <p>Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.</p>

            <p>See you tomorrow,</p>
