        <div class="section-title">How to Get Results Even When You're Busy</div>

        <p>Ever feel like you’re juggling everything—work, family, training, recovery—and still not seeing the results
            you want? When you’re balancing life and trying to get back in race shape, it can feel like there’s just not
            enough time.</p>

        <p>But here’s the truth: it doesn’t have to be this hard. You don’t need to check every box or follow a rigid
            plan to see real progress. You just need to know <span class="list-title">what to focus on next.</span></p>

        <p><span class="list-title">The Problem</span>: <br/>I hear folks say things like, “I’m too busy to keep up with a training plan.”</p>

        <p>I get it—life gets busy, and a complicated training plan can feel like just one more thing to squeeze in. But
            here’s the key: <span class="list-title">It’s not about cramming everything in</span> all the time. It’s about <span class="list-title">prioritizing</span> and <span class="list-title">blending</span>
            what matters most.</p>

        <p><span class="list-title">The Solution</span>:<br/>This is where built-in flexibility really shines. The beauty of the 6 Week Durability
            Builder and the Fully Customized Training Program is that they adapt to your schedule, not the other way
            around. They’re designed to be efficient and manageable, helping you build durability—the kind of strength
            that supports both your training and your everyday life.</p>

        <p>You don’t have to do everything all the time. Instead, focus on the consistent actions that you can fit into
            your schedule. It’s the consistency that leads to progress over time.</p>

        <p><span class="list-title">Here’s what you can do today:</span></p>
 
            <ul>
                <li><span class="list-title">Prioritize what matters now</span>: Focus on mobility and technique. These are the building blocks that will keep you injury-free and ready to push harder when you’re able.</li>
                <li><span class="list-title">Blend your training with life</span>: Take a walk with the family, work out with friends, fit in some 3DME during work breaks, or stretch while watching TV. It doesn’t have to be perfect—just consistent.</li>
                <li><span class="list-title">Commit to consistency, not perfection</span>: A few minutes of mobility work throughout the day is more effective than cramming everything into one session.</li>
            </ul>

        <p>If you’re still not sure how to make this work with your schedule, let’s set up a <span class="list-title">15-minute consultation</span>.
            I’ll help you figure out how to set the right goals for the time you have so you can keep progressing
            without feeling overwhelmed.</p>

        <p>You deserve to feel better, go faster, and stay out of pain—without the extra struggle.</p>
