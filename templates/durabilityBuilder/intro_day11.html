            <div class="section-title">You don’t need more hours. You need the right focus.</div>

            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>


            <p>Yesterday, we dug into what durability really unlocks: not just racing pain-free, but the confidence and
                consistency that carry into everyday life.</p>

            <p>Today, let’s tackle one of the biggest sticking points:<br/>“This all sounds great… but I’m too busy for
                all of it.”</p>

            <p>I get it. Life happens. Work, family, training—it feels like there’s never enough time.</p>

            <p>I get it—life gets busy, and a complicated training plan can feel like just one more thing to squeeze in.
                But
                here’s the key: <span class="list-title">It’s not about cramming everything in</span> all the time. It’s
                about <span class="list-title">prioritizing</span> and <span class="list-title">blending</span>
                what matters most.</p>

            <p>This is where smart structure comes in. You don’t need more time. You need a plan that:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Flexes with your schedule when life gets tight</li>
                <li>Builds momentum without burning you out</li>
                <li>Keeps the crucial pieces—mobility and technique—from falling off the radar</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You don’t have to do everything all the time. Instead, focus on the consistent actions that you can fit
                into
                your schedule. It’s the consistency that leads to progress over time.</p>

            <p>Because those are the first things most athletes skip, and that’s when durability starts to crack. No one
                applauds better shoulder rotation or more flexible hips—but those invisible wins? They keep you pain
                free and racing.</p>

            <p>Watch today’s video where I show you some tips on how to fit it all in.</p>

            <p>I’ve seen athletes solve this in creative ways:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Turning 3DME into family time (kids love joining in)</li>
                <li>Doing bike rides with their spouse (e-assist bikes count)</li>
                <li>Long rides and active vacations as bonding time with a partner</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It’s not about squeezing training in—it’s about blending it in.</p>

            <p>With even 8–12 minutes of daily mobility (split into 2–4 minute blocks throughout the day), you build
                resilience without overhauling your life.</p>

            <p>If you’re still feeling stretched thin, this is exactly where a smart, flexible plan shines.</p>

            <p>Let’s build one together.<a

            <div class="section-subtitle">Today’s Mobility and Technique Challenge:</div>

            <p>That chair hip opener seems innocent, but it’s like WD-40 for your hips—everything moves better. The
                low-cadence ILT (Isolated Leg Training) drill forces you to control each stroke instead of letting
                momentum do the work. If you get really good at pedaling with 1 leg, imagine how much better you’ll be
                with 2.</p>
