            <div class="section-title">Preview: Motivation fizzles. Systems and support last.</div>

            <p>Hey Athletes,</p>

            <p>Welcome back to Day 9 of the 14-Day Durability Kickstart.</p>

            <p>Have you ever felt that surge of motivation—convincing yourself this time it’s different—only for that
                energy to fizzle out a few days later? That’s the motivational trap.</p>

            <p>Motivation is like an unreliable partner. Shows up strong at first, then disappears when you need it
                most.</p>

            <p>Consistency, on the other hand, is your ideal teammate—there through every high and low, guiding you
                forward.</p>

            <p>Truth is, you don’t lack motivation.<br/>You’re missing a consistent system that fits your life and keeps
                you moving when the excitement fades.</p>

            <p>Let me give you an example:</p>

            <p>One athlete I worked with was juggling a high-stress job and chasing big running goals. He downloaded a
                generic plan that pushed him past his limits—right into a hip stress fracture. Running was how he kept
                his sanity, and now that was gone.</p>

            <p>Once we built a smarter plan around his life—and injury—he rebuilt his fitness through swimming, biking,
                mobility, and strength. And when it was time to run again, he came back stronger, more efficient, and
                with a bigger engine than ever.</p>

            <p>It wasn’t about being more motivated. It was about having a plan that made progress inevitable.</p>

            <p>That’s what the 6-Week Durability Builder is about:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A flexible system
                </li>
                <li>Personalized support
                </li>
                <li>A smart structure that adjusts to your life
                </li>
            </ul>

            <div class="section-subtitle">Today’s Mobility and Technique Challenge:</div>

            <p>Hips get cranky fast, and the lacrosse ball unlocks hidden tension that’s killing your efficiency. And
                does your swim kick suck? Learning to kick from the hips will help you glide through the water more like
                a spear and less like a water noodle.</p>
